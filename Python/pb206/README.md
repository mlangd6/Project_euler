You just have to do `./pb206.py`

At the beginning I had a solution very long : `The unique positive integer whose square has the form 1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_0 where each _ is a single digit is 1389019170 in 53.659234285354614 seconds`. 
We can see this solution between `''' '''` in the function `concealed_square`.  
So I reduce the time by half withe the new code of the function : `The unique positive integer whose square has the form 1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_0 where each _ is a single digit is 1389019170 in 25.674728870391846 seconds`
